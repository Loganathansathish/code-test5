The action genre is very broad with many sub-genres.
 Most action movies call for big action sequences,
  explosions, chases, gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, etc.

Generally speaking,
 the central plot of the script is less important compared to the high-octane action and thrills that such action stories have to offer. In action stories, it's the concept and premise that truly shines. But that doesn't mean they're easy to write. You need to be ready to conjure engaging action set pieces and raise the stakes as high as you possibly can to keep readers and audiences on the edge of their seats as the character(s) 
struggle to survive whatever you throw at them.
